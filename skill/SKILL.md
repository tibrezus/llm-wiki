description: "Operate on an LLM Wiki knowledge base — a persistent, compounding artifact maintained by LLM agents. Supports two documentation workflows: Generic (Mermaid diagrams, raw-source inputs) and Architecture/LC4 (LikeC4 models → Mermaid, code-graph-driven C4). Commands: read, update, create, prune, list, arch-sync. Use when the user asks to look something up, update wiki content, add/remove pages, sync architecture diagrams from a code graph, or get an overview of the knowledge base."

# LLM Wiki Skill

An LLM Wiki is a **persistent, compounding knowledge base** — not a RAG index.
Knowledge is compiled once and kept current by LLM agents. The human curates
sources and asks questions; the agent does the writing, cross-referencing,
filing, and bookkeeping.

## Before You Start

1. **Read `wiki.config.yml`** at the repo root — defines the project domain,
   QMD search contexts, and whether any architecture projects are declared.
2. **Read `AGENTS.md`** (copied from `.llm-wiki/instance/AGENTS.md`) for the full
   schema: page format, frontmatter rules, entity types, naming conventions,
   cross-referencing rules, and the two documentation workflows.

Never skip these files. They define the wiki's structure.

> **How the docs pipeline is built & run** (the RIG controller, KEDA/Dapr
> scheduling, the PVC cache, the event bus) lives in the **module's**
> `AGENTS.md` / `README.md` (the `.llm-wiki` submodule), not here. You do not
> need it to edit wiki content or run `arch-sync`; consult it only if asked
> how the system itself works. This skill covers *operations*; the module
> covers *architecture*.

## How to absorb this wiki (least-context routing)

The wiki is layered so you answer most questions from the **smallest** source,
not by reading the whole repo. Route by need:

| You need to… | Read this | Why it's the minimal source |
|---|---|---|
| Catch a project's **structure** fast | `raw/arch/<project>/rig.json` | deterministic code graph, 1–15K tokens; often enough on its own |
| Understand a **decision + its reasoning** | the matching `wiki/` page(s) | the *why*, captured live at decision time |
| Find **what pages exist** | `index.md` | catalog, not a dir walk |
| See **what changed recently** | `log.md` | append-only activity |
| Move between related pages | a page's `## See Also` | the bidirectional link graph |

**The two layers have distinct jobs — don't conflate them:**

- **`raw/` is the structural digest.** The RIG (`raw/arch/<project>/rig.json`)
  is a deterministic, evidence-backed code graph — the fastest way to absorb
  how a repo is built, and frequently all you need to answer a structural
  question. Prefer it over reading source files.
- **`wiki/` is the reasoning layer.** It captures decisions, rationale, and
  trade-offs made *during a development session* — recorded live, at the
  moment of the decision. This is exactly what automated structural
  summarization (the harmostes arch-sync: RIG → LikeC4 → Mermaid) does **not**
  capture: that pipeline regenerates *structure*; the wiki records *intent*.

> **Never read the whole repo to answer a wiki question.** Route to the
> minimal source above. `wiki read` and `wiki update` load only the pages that
> match the topic — not the whole tree.

## Page-size discipline

A page you can absorb in one glance is one that needs minimal context — that
is the wiki's whole point. wiki CI enforces a deterministic **line limit per
page** (`pages.size_limit`, default **400**) so no page grows past a single
glance.

- **Default: warning.** An over-limit page emits a CI annotation naming the
  page and its line count. CI stays green; the annotation is the nudge.
- **Strict: `pages.size_strict: true`** makes an over-limit page fail CI.
- **When flagged, do one of:**
  - **Shrink** — tighten prose, collapse repetition, push raw detail into
    `raw/` and link to it.
  - **Split** — extract a sub-topic into its own page, cross-link both ways,
    and update `index.md`.

Treat an over-limit page as a signal to act on the next time you touch it —
not a verdict that blocks everything. Keep new pages focused from the start
(see `wiki create`).

## Two Documentation Workflows

The wiki supports distinct workflows. Each has its own inputs, diagram tool,
and CI validation. A project can use one or both.

### Workflow 1: Generic Documentation

For documenting anything that is NOT driven by a code graph — entities,
concepts, guides, reference material. Written from raw sources (articles,
READMEs, conversations, design docs).

- **Inputs**: raw sources in `raw/` (anything the human curates).
- **Diagrams**: **Mermaid only**. Renders natively on GitHub and Obsidian.
  Many types: `sequenceDiagram`, `flowchart TD/LR` + `subgraph`,
  `stateDiagram-v2`, `erDiagram`, `gantt`, etc. Pick the type that matches the
  content.
- **CI validation**: wiki CI validates markdown + mermaid syntax.

### Workflow 2: Architecture Documentation (LC4)

> **⚠ CRITICAL: The RIG JSON is the ONLY source of truth. NEVER write
> architecture diagrams from memory. ⚠**
>
> Every component, dependency, and boundary in a C4 diagram MUST be
> traceable to a specific node in `raw/arch/<project>/rig.json`. Your training
> data about the project is IRRELEVANT — the RIG is what's real.
>
> **No RIG = no architecture workflow.** If `raw/arch/<project>/rig.json` does
> not exist, you CANNOT use this workflow. Use Generic Documentation instead.

For documenting a project's architecture from its code, driven by a
deterministic RIG (Repository Intelligence Graph) JSON. Only for projects with
a RIG in `raw/arch/`.

**Before starting, always verify the prerequisite:**

```bash
ls raw/arch/<project>/rig.json
```

If missing → **STOP**. Tell the human the RIG must be generated by CI first.
Do not invent architecture from memory.

- **Inputs**: `raw/arch/<project>/rig.json` — a [RIG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10112)
  JSON, a deterministic, evidence-backed architectural map produced by the
  project's CI. Small enough to read whole (1–15K tokens). You read it directly
  — no rollup, no budgeting, no intermediate processing.
- **Model**: **LikeC4 DSL** (`raw/arch/<project>/model.c4`). You write a typed C4
  model derived from the RIG. LikeC4 enforces C4 structure by construction.
- **Diagrams**: **Mermaid** (generated from the LikeC4 model via
  `likec4 gen mermaid`). Each LikeC4 view becomes one Mermaid diagram.
- **CI validation**: `likec4 format --check` validates the C4 model.
  Mermaid blocks are render-checked with `mmdc`.

**C4 level assignment is the LLM's job** — but only as **interpretation of the
RIG**, never as replacement. You translate RIG components into LikeC4 model
elements (systems, containers, components) and define views at each C4 level.
You do not invent entities that aren't in the RIG. If the RIG shows something
unexpected, model what the RIG shows.

**C4 ↔ RIG mapping:**

- `entrypoints` + `external_packages` → **Context** level (system + actors)
- `components` of type `executable`/`shared_library` → **Container** level
- `components` of type `package_library` + `depends_on_ids` → **Component** level
- `source_files` within a component → **Code** level
- `evidence` (file:line refs) → **traceability** annotations in descriptions
- `test_definitions` (covers_ids) → **test coverage** annotations
- `aggregators` (meta-targets) → system description context

## Commands

### `wiki read <topic>`

Search the wiki for information about a topic.

1. Search with qmd (if available):

   ```bash
   qmd query "topic" --json -n 10
   ```

2. Search with grep:

   ```bash
   grep -rl "topic" wiki/ index.md
   ```

3. Read every matching page **in full**.
4. Synthesize an answer with citations.
5. If substantial and not yet a page, offer to create one.

### `wiki update`

Ingest new information into the wiki (Generic workflow).

1. **Understand the change.** Read relevant existing pages.
2. **Save source** to `raw/` (e.g. `2026-06-26-topic-name.md`). **Never modify
   `raw/`** after saving.
3. **Update existing pages**: add information, add Markdown cross-references, update
   `sources: []` and `updated:` in frontmatter.
4. **Create new pages** for uncovered topics (correct entity-type directory).
5. **Add diagrams** as ` ```mermaid ` blocks where they help. Pick the type that
   matches the content (sequence for time-ordered, flowchart+subgraph for
   containment, etc.).
6. **Update `index.md`** and **append to `log.md`**.
7. **Validate**: `npm run check`.

### `wiki create <topic>`

Create a new wiki page.

1. Classify the entity type:
   - Specific technology/product → **entity**
   - Cross-cutting idea/pattern → **concept**
   - Step-by-step procedure → **guide**
   - Catalog/comparison/lookup → **reference**
2. Check for overlap — search `index.md` and `qmd query`.
3. Write the page:

   ```markdown
   ---
   title: Descriptive Specific Title
   type: entity|concept|guide|reference
   created: YYYY-MM-DD
   updated: YYYY-MM-DD
   sources: []
   tags: [type-tag, tag2, tag3]
   ---

   # Descriptive Specific Title

   Dense keyword-rich summary (2-3 sentences).

   ## Section Title

   Body with [Markdown links](../type/page-name.md) to other pages.

   ## See Also

   - [related-1](../type/related-1.md) — description
   - [related-2](../type/related-2.md) — description
   ```

4. Add Markdown links from existing pages to the new page. Use relative paths:
   from `wiki/concepts/x.md` to `wiki/entities/y.md` → `[y](../entities/y.md)`.
5. Ensure bidirectional links.
6. Update `index.md`, append to `log.md`, validate with `npm run check`.

### `wiki arch-sync <project>`

Sync architecture model and diagrams from an updated RIG (Architecture/LC4 workflow).
Run when `raw/arch/<project>/rig.json` has changed.

> **⚠ Every diagram you produce MUST be derived from the RIG. NEVER write
> architecture from memory or training data. If a component or dependency is
> not in the RIG, it does not go in the diagram. ⚠**

1. **Verify the RIG exists** (prerequisite gate):

   ```bash
   ls raw/arch/<project>/rig.json
   ```

   If missing → **STOP**. Tell the human the RIG must be generated by CI
   first. Do not proceed.

2. **Detect change**: `git log -p -- raw/arch/<project>/rig.json`.
3. **Read the RIG**: `cat raw/arch/<project>/rig.json`. This is a deterministic
   JSON — read it whole. Identify components, their types, dependencies
   (`depends_on_ids`), external packages, entrypoints, **evidence** (file:line
   refs proving each node is build-defined), **test_definitions** (which
   components have tests), and **aggregators** (meta-targets like `go-build-all`).
4. **Update the LikeC4 model** (`raw/arch/<project>/model.c4`). Translate RIG
   components into typed C4 elements. Every element must correspond to a real
   entry in the RIG. **Do not include anything that is not in the RIG.**

   ### RIG → C4 Mapping Guide

   The RIG is the authoritative architectural map (arXiv:2601.10112). Your job
   is to transform it into a human-readable C4 model that communicates
   architecture, not just mirror the JSON. Follow these rules:

   **Level 1 — System Context view:**
   - One `softwareSystem` node for the entire project.
   - `entrypoints` in the RIG → note them in the system description ("entrypoints:
     X server, Y CLI").
   - `external_packages` → model significant ones as `externalSystem` nodes
     connected to the system with relationships. Group related packages
     (e.g., all Docker packages → "Docker Engine", all OpenAI packages →
     "OpenAI API"). Skip trivial packages (stdlib-adjacent, test utilities).
   - This view answers: "What is this system, what does it talk to?"

   **Level 2 — Container view:**
   - Map RIG `executable` components → `container` nodes (e.g., API server,
     CLI tool, worker process).
   - Map RIG `package_library` / `static_library` / `shared_library` → group
     them into functional containers based on their names and dependencies.
     For example:
     - Components with `api/` in source paths → "REST API" container
     - Components with `state/` or `store/` → "State Management" container
     - Components with `tf` or `terraform` → "Infrastructure Adapter" container
     - CUDA/C files → "GPU Backend" container
   - Draw `depends_on_ids` edges between containers.
   - This view answers: "What are the major building blocks and how do they connect?"

   **Level 3 — Component view (one per container):**
   - Each RIG component within a container → a C4 `component` node.
   - List ALL source files from the RIG in the description (compact format).
   - Draw internal `depends_on_ids` edges as relationships.
   - `external_packages_ids` → model as relationships to `externalSystem` nodes
     defined in the Context view.
   - This view answers: "What's inside each building block?"

   **Using evidence and test_definitions (paper compliance):**
   - `evidence` entries provide `file:line` refs proving each component is
     build-defined. Reference the evidence in component descriptions for
     traceability (e.g., "defined at `go.mod:1`, root source `main.go`").
   - `test_definitions` link tests to tested components via `covers_ids`.
     Use this to annotate which components have test coverage in the model.
     Components without tests should be noted as "no test coverage".
   - `aggregators` (e.g., `go-build-all`, `go-test-all`) show the build
     target graph. Mention them in the system description.

   **Description quality rules:**
   - Don't just quote the RIG verbatim. SYNTHESIZE: use the component name,
     type, source file paths, and dependency pattern to write a 1-2 sentence
     description of the component's architectural role.
   - Example: instead of `comp-6 machine — internal/api/machine/handlers.go`,
     write `machine — REST API handlers for machine CRUD operations; depends
     on state store and patch resolution for declarative updates`.
   - Include the RIG component ID in a comment for traceability:
     `// RIG comp-6`.
5. **Regenerate Mermaid** — `likec4 gen mermaid -o /tmp/out raw/arch/<project>/`.
   Each C4 view becomes one Mermaid diagram. Embed all views on the wiki page.
6. **Update wiki pages** — replace the embedded Mermaid blocks with the
   regenerated output.
   **PRESERVE manual content**: Read the existing wiki page first. Only
   replace the architecture diagram section (containing LikeC4-generated
   Mermaid). Keep ALL manually-written sections — deployment notes,
   configuration examples, manual architecture insights, operational runbooks.
   If unsure whether a section is agent-generated or manual, preserve it.
7. **Update `sources:`** with `raw/arch/<project>/rig.json`.
8. **Update `index.md`** and **append to `log.md`** with operation `arch-sync`.
9. **Validate**: `npm run check` (CI also validates the LikeC4 model).

### `wiki consult <project-repo-path>`

Help a project set up RIG graph generation (promotion to LC4). Inspects the
project repo, determines its language and build system, generates a CI
workflow that uses the reusable repo-map Action, and writes it into the
project repo.

> This command operates on the **project repo** (not the wiki). It is the
> only skill command that writes outside the wiki. It exists to *establish*
> the project→graph→wiki pipeline, then gets out of the way.

1. **Inspect the project repo** at `<project-repo-path>`:
   - Detect the language: check for `go.mod` (Go), `package.json` (TS/JS),
     `pyproject.toml`/`setup.py` (Python), `Cargo.toml` (Rust).
   - Detect the build system.
2. **Generate the workflow** that produces a RIG JSON using the reusable
   Action `tibrezus/llm-wiki/.github/actions/repo-map@vN`:

   ```yaml
   # .github/workflows/repo-map.yml
   name: Generate RIG
   on:
     push:
       tags: ['v*']
   jobs:
     rig:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - uses: actions/checkout@v4
         - uses: tibrezus/llm-wiki/.github/actions/repo-map@v1
           with:
             language: go          # detected language
         - name: Publish RIG
           uses: softprops/action-gh-release@v2
           with:
             files: repo-map.json
   ```

3. **Write the workflow** into `<project-repo-path>/.github/workflows/repo-map.yml`.
4. **Open a PR** in the project repo. After merge, the project will
   deterministically publish `repo-map.json` as a Release asset on every tag.
5. **If the project repo is private**, create a read-scoped token (fine-grained
   PAT on GitHub, or an access token on Forgejo) and store it as a CI secret in
   the **wiki** repo: `gh secret set <PROJECT>_RIG_TOKEN` (GitHub) or the
   equivalent in Forgejo. Then declare it in the wiki's `arch:` config as
   `rig_token_env: <PROJECT>_RIG_TOKEN` alongside `rig_url`. Public repos skip
   this step.
6. **Tell the human** to add the project to the wiki's `arch:` config with the
   Release asset URL as `rig_url` (and `rig_token_env` if private). From that
   point, the wiki CI will fetch and commit the RIG, and LC4 unlocks.
7. **After the first RIG lands** in `raw/arch/<project>/rig.json`, run the
   `arch-sync` command to write the initial LikeC4 model (`.c4`) from the RIG
   and generate the Mermaid architecture diagrams.

### `wiki prune <topic>`

Remove a page. **Never without explicit instruction.**

1. Find the page: `find wiki/ -name "topic.md"`.
2. Find all inbound links: `grep -rl "topic" wiki/` (check both `[topic](` and `[[topic]]`).
3. Remove/update Markdown links from referencing pages.
4. Delete the file.
5. Remove from `index.md`, append to `log.md`, validate.

### `wiki list`

Summarize the wiki contents.

1. Read `index.md` for the catalog.
2. Count pages by type:

   ```bash
   find wiki/entities -name "*.md" | wc -l
   find wiki/concepts -name "*.md" | wc -l
   find wiki/guides -name "*.md" | wc -l
   find wiki/reference -name "*.md" | wc -l
   ```

3. Check for architecture projects:

   ```bash
   ls -d raw/arch/*/ 2>/dev/null
   ```

4. Run health check:

   ```bash
   python3 .llm-wiki/scripts/wiki-health.py wiki/
   ```

5. Present: page counts, architecture projects, recent updates, warnings.

## Diagram Rules by Workflow

| Workflow | Tool | When | CI checks |
|----------|------|------|----------|
| Generic Documentation | **Mermaid only** | documenting from raw sources | markdown + mermaid render validity |
| Architecture (LC4) | **LikeC4 → Mermaid** | documenting from a code graph | C4 model validity + mermaid render |

Never mix: no LikeC4 models in generic docs, no hand-written Mermaid for C4
architecture diagrams (generate from the model).

### Mermaid type guide (Generic)

| Content | Type |
|---------|------|
| Time-ordered triggers | `sequenceDiagram` |
| Nested topology / containment | `flowchart TD` + `subgraph` |
| Linear pipeline / fan-out | `flowchart LR` |
| Dependency chain | `flowchart TD` |
| Decision branches | `flowchart TD` with `{rhombus}` |
| State transitions | `stateDiagram-v2` |
| Schema / relationships | `erDiagram`, `classDiagram` |
| Timeline / phases | `gantt`, `journey` |

Use ` ```text ` for file trees, procedures, pseudo-code, templates — not diagrams.

### LikeC4 C4 guide (Architecture)

| C4 Level | Scope | LikeC4 element/view |
|----------|-------|---------------------|
| Context | whole system + actors | `system` elements; `view` with `include *` |
| Container | one project | `container` in `system`; `view of <system>` |
| Component | one module | `component` in `container`; `view of <container>` |
| Code | few files | `component` details; `view of <component>` |

## Commit and Verify

A wiki change is **not done** when the local files are written. It is done
only when it is **committed, pushed to the remote, and CI is green**.

Local validation (`npm run check`) is necessary but not sufficient — it does
not catch submodule drift, tool-version differences, or environment-specific
failures. CI also validates diagrams (Mermaid render-checked via `mmdc`,
LikeC4 models via `likec4 format --check`) that local checks do not. Only the
remote CI run is authoritative.

The workflow, end to end:

1. Write the change locally.
2. `npm run check` — fast local gate (catches obvious mistakes early).
3. Commit and **push** to the remote.
4. **Watch the CI run** and confirm it is green. If it fails, fix and push
   again until it is green.
5. Only then is the change considered complete.

Use the right tool for the remote — they are NOT interchangeable:

- **GitHub** repos: use **`gh`** (`gh run watch`, `gh run list`).
- **Forgejo** repos: use **`fj`** (`fj actions tasks`, `fj actions jobs`).

Determine the platform from the remote URL before pushing, and use the
corresponding tool to watch CI. Do not assume — check.

## Validation Checklist

Before committing any wiki change:

- [ ] `npm run check` passes (markdownlint + remark + wiki-health)
- [ ] New pages: all 6 frontmatter fields present, correct type directory
- [ ] Tags: 2-7 items, first matches type, all lowercase
- [ ] `## See Also` with ≥2 links
- [ ] No duplicate filenames across `wiki/`
- [ ] `index.md` updated, `log.md` appended
- [ ] Bidirectional links maintained
- [ ] No `#` body headings, no inline HTML
